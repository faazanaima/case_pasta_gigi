This study aimed to predict toothpaste brands based on an analysis of dental 
conditions and price preferences using the Random Forest algorithm and the CRISP-DM 
approach. The research results indicated that the variables of tooth color range and frequency 
of toothache had the highest influence, suggesting that consumers were more likely to 
choose a brand based on tooth color and sensitivity. Evaluation using the Confusion Matrix 
and Classification Report models demonstrated good performance with an accuracy of 
91.3%. Based on the result, the model could serve as a robust foundation for developing a 
GUI-based Toothpaste Brand Prediction Application using the tkinter library, assisting 
users in making more informed decisions.
